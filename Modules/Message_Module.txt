Functions:
1. Filters chat for explicit contents.
2. Deletes explicit contents from chat.

Note: The words filtered are subject
      to additon, removal, editing, 
      and other forms of change.
      Any attempts to bypass the filter
      are up to the staff of the server
      that said attempts take place in 
      to moderate.
      Echo is not responsible for any 
      words that make it through the
      filter, nor should the filter be
      relied on as the sole method of 
      keeping chat non-explicit.
